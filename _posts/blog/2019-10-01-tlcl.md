## Linux 可以激发我们的想象

By William Shotts

当我被要求解释 Windows 与 Linux 之间的差异时，我经常拿玩具来作比喻。



Windows 就像一个游戏机。你去商店，买了一个包装在盒子里面的游戏机。你把它带回家，打开盒子，开始玩游戏。精美的画面，动人的声音。玩了一段时间之后，你厌倦了它自带的游戏，所以你返回商店，又买了另一个游戏机。这个过程反复重复。最后，你玩腻了游戏机自带的游戏，你回到商店，告诉售货员，“我想要一个这样的游戏！” 但售货员告诉你没有这样的游戏存在，因为它没有“市场需求”。然后你说，“我只需要修改一下这个游戏！”，售货员告诉你不能修改它。所有游戏都被封装在它们的存储器中。到头来，你发现你的玩具局限于别人为你规定好的游戏。



Linux 就像一个世界上最大的建造模型。你打开它，发现它是巨大的部件集合。有许多钢支柱、螺钉、螺母、齿轮、滑轮、发动机和一些怎样来建造它的说明书。然后你开始摆弄它。你建造了一个又一个标准模型。过了一会儿，你发现你要建造自己的模型。你不用回到商店，因为你已经拥有了你需要的一切。模型以你的构想为模板，搭建任何你想要的。



当然，选择哪一个玩具，是你的事情。但你觉得哪一个玩具更有乐趣，更让人满足呢？

## Linux Is About Imagination

When I am asked to explain the difference between Windows and Linux, I often use a toy analogy.

Windows is like a Game Boy. You go to the store and buy one all shiny new in the box. You take it home, turn it on and play with it. Pretty graphics, cute sounds. After a while though, you get tired of the game that came with it so you go back to the store and buy another one. This cycle repeats over and over. Finally, you go back to the store and say to the person behind the counter, “I want a game that does this!” only to be told that no such game exists because there is no “market demand” for it. Then you say, “But I only need to change this one thing!” The person behind the counter says you can’t change it. The games are all sealed up in their cartridges. You discover that your toy is limited to the games that others have decided that you need and no more.

Linux, on the other hand, is like the world’s largest Erector Set. You open it up and it’s just a huge collection of parts. A lot of steel struts, screws, nuts, gears, pulleys, motors, and a few suggestions on what to build. So you start to play with it. You build one of the suggestions and then another. After a while you discover that you have your own ideas of what to make. You don’t ever have to go back to the store, as you already have everything you need. The Erector Set takes on the shape of your imagination. It does what you want.

Your choice of toys is, of course, a personal thing, so which toy would you find more satisfying?
